        IMPORTANT: Ensure that you are connected to the internet when playing the game.\n
        To catch a Startup, turn on the GPS and wait for a few seconds until it acquires your location.\n
        If a Startup is around, your phone will vibrate and you will be prompted to catch it.\n
        If nothing shows up, try moving to a different location or wait for a few minutes.\n\n
        In case you need practice to adjust to the catching mechanism, use the Catching Practice Mode.\n
        Catching a Startup is easiest when using a Masterball and the difficulty rises as you move downwards\n
        You can get Cashballs from FundingPoints in the insti. However, note that you can only use 1 point once every 10 minutes.\n
        There is a box limit on the number of Startup you can catch. The default limit is 50.\n
        If you exceed the limit, you will be prompted to release Startup.\n
        To level up your Startup, select the Startup in \'My Startup\' section and click the level up button to be redirected to the level-up minigame.\n
        The minigame requires you to tap on the Startup for a given number of times in a set time limit to level up.\n
        To trade Startups, go to the Trade section and Scan for other players. If another player is already scanning, wait until they are connected to you.\n
        Click on the Startup you want to trade and once the other player has selected theirs, the trade will take place\n
        To capture a Tower, tap on it. You will be prompted to select the startup to guard the tower.\n
        If the tower is already captured, you will have to battle the Startup that is guarding it and defeat it.\n
        Note that you can only capture one tower at a time.\n
        Good luck and have fun!\n

    <string name="catch_prac">
        The trajectory of the cashball is dependent on the fling speed and the angle at which you shoot it.\n
        The cashball must follow a parabolic path and land on the Startup to capture it.\n
        If the speed isn\'t correct, the cashball might go through the Startup instead of capturing it.\n
        The thresholds are smallest for the Cashball and highest for the MasterCashBall.\n
        Therefore, it will be easier to capture Startup with a MasterCashBall or an UltraCashBall than a Cashball.\n
        \n\n
        GET AS MUCH PRACTICE AS YOU CAN BECAUSE YOU\'LL ONLY GET THREE CHANCES TO CAPTURE A STARTUP\n
